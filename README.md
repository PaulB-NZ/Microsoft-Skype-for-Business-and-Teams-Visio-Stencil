Skype for Business and Teams Visio Stencil - V3
===============================================

As I start thinking about the design of Skype for Business solutions it becomes apparent to me that its time for a new visio stencil. Having been a little reserved with the new images that were introduced in the Lync 2013 stencil I thought its time to embrace the new.

Having taken a look at these I must say that these will need to grow on me. Not a big fan of the dark shadow looking images that represent the servers (yet!). Feels a bit gloomy to me, I need clean, open looking shapes.

So what shapes are in the stencil?

* Skype for Business Servers, Roles and clients
* Anywhere 365 Servers
* Zeacom Servers
* Sonus SBCs
* Audiocodes SBCs
* All the usual Infrastructure and Server roles
* A bunch of Skype for Business\Lync related components

Of course I will update the library of shapes as and when needed. Happy to take on board suggestions.
